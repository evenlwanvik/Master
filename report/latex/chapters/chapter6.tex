\chapter{Conclusion}

This report has discussed the possibility that a disruption in the autoregulatory mechanisms for a septic patient is observable in hemodynamic parameters such as systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and arterial compliance. The main objective of the project was to investigate the possibility of detecting these disruptions. The hypothesis was that the abnormalities would manifest as an increase in the average magnitude of the lower frequencies of the parameters. The SVR and compliance of seven patients were successfully calculated and analyzed in both the time and frequency domain. Although there seems to be some correlation, there is not enough evidence to employ this to aid in diagnostics of sepsis. I do, however, believe there is potential for further and more comprehensive studies on this matter, and I do see the potential to develop related research with this project's results and potential for development as a baseline.
